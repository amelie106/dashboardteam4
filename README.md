# COVID-19 Dashboard

## Project Description

This is a university data analysis project on COVID-19 data, specifically cases/deaths per country as a function of time. 
The visualization of the evolution of the pandemic is accessible as an interactive dashboard.
As it is a commonly used and reliable source, we referred to the data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases).
